# Hi, I'm Danial Goodarzi

I am a researcher specializing in **fluid mechanics, environmental hydraulics, and computational modeling**, with expertise in both experimental and numerical approaches. My PhD research focuses on **thermal and saline buoyant jets**, exploring the interaction of environmental discharges with ambient.
