## 🔬 About Me

I am a researcher specializing in **fluid mechanics, environmental hydraulics, and computational modeling**, with strong expertise in both experimental and numerical approaches. My PhD research focuses on **thermal and saline buoyant jets**, exploring the interaction of environmental discharges with ambient waters using **high-fidelity CFD simulations** and **laser-based laboratory experiments**.

I bring together advanced techniques like:

- ✅ **Large Eddy Simulation (LES)** and **Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)**
- ✅ **Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF)** and **Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)**
- ✅ **Machine Learning** for developing surrogate and multi-fidelity models
- ✅ **Multi-physics CFD modeling** using **OpenFOAM** and **CFDEM**
